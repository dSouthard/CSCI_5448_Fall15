#### Ryan Milvenan & Diana Southard

### Project Summary
<p>This project is an Android application that tracks which of Colorado’s famous “14ers” a user has hiked, how long each hike took, and overall average hiking length over all recorded hikes. The application will also present all mountain peaks locations along with brief summaries when any individual peak is selected which will include the mountain’s actual height and which mountain range it is a part of.
